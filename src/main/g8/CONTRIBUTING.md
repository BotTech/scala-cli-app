## Contributing

All contributions are welcome.

Take a look at the [Main Board] and see if there is anything in the `To do` column which you would like to work on.
The highest priority issues are at the top.

You may also look for any issues that are labeled with [help wanted].

Just because an issue does not have the [help wanted] label does not mean that help is not appreciated but just be aware
that we may already have plans to work on it.

Add a comment to the ticket to say that you are working on the issue and we will assign it to you and update the
relevant boards.

### Verified Commits

Make sure that you sign all your commits. See [Github - Signing Commits] for more details.

### Testing

#### Unit Tests

Run `test` for regular unit tests.

### Versioning

Version numbers are determined automatically using [dwijnand/sbt-dynver].

To create a new version add a new git annotated tag:
```bash
git tag -as v1.1.0
```

NOTE: The tag must be annotated (`-a`) and signed (`-s`).

### Continuous Integration

Continuous integration builds are done with [Travis CI].

### Publishing

The Travis CI build will automatically publish to [Bintray] and [GitHub] for all tagged commits on master.

#### Signed Artifacts

The artifacts are signed with key belonging to [$organizationName$]. Reach out to us if there are any issues with this.

#### Bintray

This uses [sbt/sbt-bintray] to publish artifacts to Bintray and [ohnosequences/sbt-github-release] to publish to GitHub.
